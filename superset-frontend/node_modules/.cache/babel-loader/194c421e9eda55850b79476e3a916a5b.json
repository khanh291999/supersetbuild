In addition to containing information of which\n * datasource to use, it specifies the type (e.g. full payload, samples, query) and\n * format (e.g. CSV or JSON) of the result and whether or not to force refresh the data from\n * the datasource as opposed to using a cached copy of the data, if available.\n *\n * More importantly though, QueryContext contains a property `queries`, which is an array of\n * QueryObjects specifying individual data requests to be made. A QueryObject specifies which\n * columns, metrics and filters, among others, to use during the query. Usually it will be enough\n * to specify just one query based on the baseQueryObject, but for some more advanced use cases\n * it is possible to define post processing operations in the QueryObject, or multiple queries\n * if a viz needs multiple different result sets.\n */\nexport default function buildQuery(formData) {\n  return buildQueryContext(formData, (baseQueryObject) => [\n  {\n    result_type: 'columns',\n    columns: [],\n    metrics: [],\n    orderby: [] }]);\n\n\n}","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
